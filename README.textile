h1. Ajaxify Nested Attributes jQuery Plugin

Ruby on Rails provides a really nice mechanism for managing nested models in a form. Adding and deleting nested models can be annoying, until you get the hang of it. Even then, the code that one uses to add and remove these items from the DOM is often not very portable.

This jQuery plugin attempts to provide a generic means with which to add/remove nested attributes to/from a form. It was built with RoR in mind, but can by used with any server platform that can respond to a JSON request. Form element naming convention follows the Rails norm, however, so please reference the API documentation for fields_for (and accepts_nested_attributes_for) for an understanding of the output of this plugin.
